Graffo is an open-source interactive task management system that combines Markdown-based to-do lists with a dynamic graph visualization. It allows developers, teams, and individuals to organize tasks, visualize dependencies, and track progress in a unique, visual way.

---

## üöÄ Features (WIP)

- **Import plain text or Markdown** to automatically create interactive task lists.  
- **Tasks as graph nodes**: subtasks become child nodes, and dependencies are represented as edges.  
- **Interactive graph visualization**: see your tasks and their relationships in a dynamic, color-coded graph.  
- **Tags and cross-links**: organize tasks with tags (`#frontend`) or connect related tasks with links (`[[related task]]`).  
- **Progress tracking**: nodes show status (pending, in-progress, done) and completion percentage for subtasks.  
- **Markdown export**: full portability with `.md` files.  
- **Git integration**: version your task list, track changes, and collaborate seamlessly.  
- **CLI/API support**: create, update, and query tasks programmatically, perfect for automation and CI/CD pipelines.
